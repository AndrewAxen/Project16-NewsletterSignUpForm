I have integrated the Newsletter sign-up form, originally developed locally in Day 2, Lesson 1 Defending against XSS, into the contact-us.html page. Additionally, a phone number field has been added with restrictions using the maxlength attribute. A JavaScript function has been implemented to retrieve and validate the phone number input, ensuring it contains only numbers and dashes. In case of any issues, an error message is prepared, and if the input is valid, it is sanitized before form submission.
